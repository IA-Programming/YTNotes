## 📖 Introduction

YT Notes is a Chrome extension that allows users to save and chat with their YouTube videos, enhancing information retention and accessibility. Developed during the Langflow Hackathon in July 2024, our project aims to revolutionize how people interact with educational content on YouTube.

## ❗ Problem

According to recent data, 92% of people watch YouTube videos for information and knowledge. However, many users struggle to retain and reference important information from these videos. With the vast amount of content available, it can be challenging to remember key points or locate specific details later, leading to wasted time searching for videos or rewatching content.

## 💡 Solution

YT Notes addresses these challenges by providing a seamless extension that allows users to:
- Save transcriptions of YouTube videos directly into a database
- Use an intelligent chat feature to ask questions about previously watched content
- Receive accurate responses linked to specific videos

This enhances retention and streamlines the learning process, making information easily accessible and actionable.
